# BEC_impurity_dynamics
Research done during my Masters thesis at McMaster University. I solved the time-dependent Schrodinger equation for a Bosonic Josephson Junction coupled to an impurity with a time dependent interaction energy. 

All of the code here is written in C++ and it is essentially a generalized ordinary differential equation solver for highly coupled systems through an explicit RK4 algorithm. The code is made compatible with a schedular through Compute Canadas super computing cluster.
